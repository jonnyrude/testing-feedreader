# To Run this Application:
Download or clone this repo, and open the index.html file. That's it!

This project uses the JavaScript testing framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test an RSS feed reader
application. You will see the Jasmine test results at the bottom of the page.

## How does it work?

The application itself uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON object we can make use of. It also uses the Handlebars templating library and jQuery.

# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and an empty test suite file feedreader.js.


## What I learned:

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tests focus on the
underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
